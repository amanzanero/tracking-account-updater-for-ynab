# YNAB Tracking Updater

I built this little app to help me update all my tracking accounts in YNAB in bulk.

Otherwise, you have to go reconcile each account manually. This just pulls up a table and allows you to edit the balance on each one, and it'll go ahead and create transactions that you can go ahead and approve in YNAB.
